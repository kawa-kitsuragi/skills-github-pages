# Hi, I'm Kawa!

I’m a community organizer in indie games, and you’ve found my portfolio. 

I am not actively looking for work on commercial games right now, but if you'd like to see what I was doing as a producer, you can check out my old [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M8HK6w2oGwE1JtHIkkc_c0yYWY6mwngHw0iXDx0pl6s/edit?tab=t.0).

You can check out my Projects section above (WIP) for some things I’ve done.

My pronouns are [they/them](https://en.pronouns.page/they/them).
